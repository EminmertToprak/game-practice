# 🐸 The Console.Frog();

## ❓What is it?

    "Console.Frog();" is a project made by Mert Toprak for Ironhack to exersize and bring the information he learnt at course to life. The game influenced from the good old retro game called Frogger from 1982. Our main character is a frog (hungry, hungry one) who tries to catch and eat bugs and while doing it, don't got hit by a car or truck. Also there is a river which hosting to a _golden_ fly, but our froggy should be careful about the stream in the river.

## 🎮 How to Play?

      As soon as the player reads the instructions and clicks Play Game in the landing page, our frog friend appears in the bottom middle of screen. Player can move it by either W A S D or Arrow Keys. Aim is collecting 10 points before die.

         When frog landed on water elements, it also moves by itself (either stream or objects on the water). If player touches any sides of the river, it's also game over.
- ### ✔️ Milestone 6:
